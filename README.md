This repository assembles the neural network models for QuakeSaver seismic sensors.

The [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) models are assembled in [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html), which are executed on-the-edge on the QuakeSaver sensor's firmware.

## Available Models

We are actively working on bringing neural networks for seismology and building health monitoring to the edge.

### PhaseNet

PhaseNet phase detector for P- and S- wave phase picks trained by [SeisBench](https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench) on various large data sets:

* ethz
* geofon
* instance
* iquique
* lendb
* neic
* original
* scedc
* stead

## Development Installation

Local installation of the helper repositoy

```sh
pip3 install .
```

### Development

We utilize `pre-commit` for clean commits.

```sh
pre-commit install
```

## Distribution of Models

Distribution of the TorchScript models is carried out by GitHub actions. See the `.github/workflow` folder for details on continuous deployment. The sensors fetch models from the released artifacts.
